# Image-Processing-in-Kotlin

## Kotlin Thursdays: Image Processing in Kotlin Part 1 
Welcome to Kotlin Thursdays and Happy Halloween!  This week, we will be exploring image processing in Kotlin.  If you have used applications like Instagram, Snapchat, or even Photoshop, you may already be familiar with image processing and not even know it!  

Image processing is not specific to Kotlin, but playing with images can help us think about how algorithms are applied in a 2-D matrix and develop computational thinking.  Once we get the basics down, the world is your oyster!

We will be leveraging TornadoFX, a JavaFX framework written in Kotlin for native desktop development.  Let's get started setting up our TornadoFX project!
